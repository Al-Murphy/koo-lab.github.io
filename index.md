The **Woo Lab** is a neuroimaging research lab led by 
<a href="http://wanirepo.github.io">Dr. Choong-Wan Woo</a>.  

We are joining the <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr">IBS</a> <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/">Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR)</a> <a href="http://www.skku.edu/eng_home/index.jsp">at Sungkyunkwan University</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University">Wikipedia</a>) located in Suwon, South Korea (starting March 2017). How exciting!

Our research mainly focuses on understanding 'pain' and 'emotions' in the perspective of **Co**mputational, **Co**gnitive, and **A**ffective (aka **CoCoA**) Neuroscience. It sounds sweet, doesn't it?

Our main research tools include functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), psychophysiology measures (skin conductance, pupilometry, electrocardiogram, respiration), electroencephalogram (EEG), and other behavioral measures such as face camera, eye-tracker, and so on. Most importantly, we use computational tools to model our cognition, emotions, and behaviors.  


(There is a secret: We also use many different pain devices, such as heat delivery system, pressure pain device, capsaicin (sometimes hot chili pepper).
