**WooLab** is a neuroimaging research lab led by 
<a href="http://wanirepo.github.io">Dr. Choong-Wan Woo</a>.  

We are joining the <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr">IBS</a> <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/">Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR)</a> <a href="http://www.skku.edu/eng_home/index.jsp">at Sungkyunkwan University</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University">Wikipedia</a>) located in Suwon, South Korea (starting March 2017). 

<i>Machine learning, precision medicine, neural networks, neuroimaging biomarkers, translational research, encoding-decoding models, mind reading, complex system...</i>  
These are the **Keywords** of our research. 

Our research mainly focuses on understanding 'pain' and 'emotions' in the perspective of **Co**mputational, **Co**gnitive, and **A**ffective (aka **CoCoA**) Neuroscience. We also aim to develop clinically useful neuroimaging models and tools that can be used and shared across different research groups and clinical settings. 

Our main research tools include functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), psychophysiology measures (skin conductance, pupilometry, electrocardiogram, respiration), electroencephalogram (EEG), and other behavioral measures such as face recording camera, eye-tracker, etc. Most importantly, we use computational tools to model and understand our affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses.
