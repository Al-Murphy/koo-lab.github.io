<b><span style="font-size: 16px !important; color: #BD0026;">Cocoan lab</span></b> <span style="font-size: 16px !important;"> is a neuroimaging research lab led by Dr. Choong-Wan Woo.</span>  

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">We are joining the <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr">IBS</a> <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/">Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR)</a> at <a href="http://www.skku.edu/eng_home/index.jsp">Sungkyunkwan University</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University">Wikipedia</a>) located in Suwon, South Korea (starting March 2017).</span> 

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">The **keywords** of our research include:</span>  
<span style="font-size: 14px !important;color: #777;">fMRI; Machine learning; Neuroimaging biomarkers; Data science; Translational research; Predictive modeling; Brain decoding, Encoding-decoding model; Pain; Emotions; Psychiatric and neurologic disorders; Mind-body interaction; Behavioral medicine; Network science; Psychological and social pain modulation; Emotion regulation, and more.</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">The mission of our lab is to understand <span style="color: #BD0026;">pain</span> and <span style="color: #BD0026;">emotions</span> in the perspective of data science, cognitive/affective/social neuroscience, and psychology. We also aim to develop clinically useful neuroimaging models and tools that can be used and shared across different research groups and clinical settings.</span> 

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">Our main research tools include functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), psychophysiology measures (skin conductance, pupilometry, electrocardiogram, respiration), electroencephalogram (EEG), and other behavioral measures such as facial expression, eye movement, etc. Most importantly, we use data science (computational) tools to model and understand affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses.</span>  

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">[We are currently looking for talented and enthusiastic people for the lab!](/jobs/)</span>

- <span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Current openings: 1 or 2 graduate students (for AY 2019), 1 or 2 undergrad RAs</span>

<span style="font-size: 16px !important;">If you are interested in participating our experiments, [please visit here.](/participation/)</span>
