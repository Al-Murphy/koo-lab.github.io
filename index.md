<b><span style="font-size: 13.5px !important; color: #BD0026;">Woo</span><span style="font-size: 13.5px !important;">Lab</b> is a neuroimaging research lab led by 
<a href="http://wanirepo.github.io">Dr. Choong-Wan Woo</a>.</span>  

<br>
<span style="font-size: 13.5px !important;">We are joining the <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr">IBS</a> <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/">Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR)</a> at <a href="http://www.skku.edu/eng_home/index.jsp">Sungkyunkwan University</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungkyunkwan_University">Wikipedia</a>) located in Suwon, South Korea (starting March 2017).</span> 

<br>
<span style="font-size: 13.5px !important;">The **keywords** of our research include:  
<span style="color: #555;">fMRI; Machine learning; Neuroimaging biomarker; Translational research; Predictive modeling; Brain decoding, Encoding-decoding model; Pain; Emotions; Psychiatric and neurologic disorders; Mind-body interaction; Behavioral medicine; Network science; Psychological and social pain modulation; Emotion regulation, and more.</span></span>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 13.5px !important;">Our research mainly focuses on understanding <span style="color: #BD0026;">pain</span> and <span style="color: #BD0026;">emotions</span> in the perspective of Computational, Cognitive, and Affective (aka **CoCoA**) Neuroscience. We also aim to develop clinically useful neuroimaging models and tools that can be used and shared across different research groups and clinical settings.</span> 

<br>
<span style="font-size: 13.5px !important;">Our main research tools include functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), psychophysiology measures (skin conductance, pupilometry, electrocardiogram, respiration), electroencephalogram (EEG), and other behavioral measures such as face recording camera, eye-tracker, etc. Most importantly, we use computational tools to model and understand our affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses.</span>
