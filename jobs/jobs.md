<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Postdoctoral fellow</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">WooLab (<a href="http://wanirepo.github.io">Dr. Choong-Wan Woo</a>) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow beginning March 2017 (but specific start date is flexible). We investigate how the brain represents, processes, and regulates pain and emotions. Particularly, our research focuses on the development of clinically useful neuroimaging models and tools using machine learning and computational modeling approaches (for example, see Woo et al., 2017, <i>Nat Neurosci</i>).</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Our lab is a part of the <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/">Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (CNIR)</a> at <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr">Institute for Basic Science (IBS)</a> in South Korea. Since IBS is a government-funded research institute, our lab will have stable funding for the next few years. Most importantly, our lab will have a full access to the CNIR’s brand-new neuroimaging <a href="http://cnir.ibs.re.kr/_prog/equipments/?&site_dvs_cd=cnir_en&menu_dvs_cd=050101">facilities and equipments</a> for conducting cutting-edge research. The facilities include animal and human MRIs (3T, 9.4T, 15.2T), two-photon microscope, super high-resolution confocal microscope, high performance computing clusters, electronic and machine shop, histology lab, and rodent and non-human primate animal housing. Our center and the lab have a strong emphasis on promoting an open, synergetic, multi-disciplinary, and creative research environment. Therefore, you will be able to experience active discussions and collaborations with other scientists from different fields of expertise.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">The successful candidate should be highly motivated and also have a strong background in computational methods and neuroimaging experiment and data analysis. Computer programming skills (Matlab or Python; our lab is currently using Matlab) will be important, and other analysis skills (e.g., machine learning, network analysis, computational modeling) and a good publication record will be greatly helpful. Having growth, innovation, collaborative mindsets will be crucial, and the ability to develop and express abstract ideas will be helpful. Writing skills are also important.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Compensation will be competitive and commensurate with experience (comparable to NIH). Four major public insurances (national pension, health insurance, unemployment insurance, industrial accident) will be also supported.</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">For those who are afraid of living in South Korea: South Korea has many beautiful places to visit and most importantly great food. Here are some helpful information and fun	 video clips:</span>
