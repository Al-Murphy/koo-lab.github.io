        The <b>Koo Laboratory</b> studies the functional impact of genomic variants through a computational lens using deep learning. We are broadly interested in gene regulation, RNA-protein interactions, and protein structure. Our approach develops methods to interpret high-performing deep learning models to distill knowledge that they learn from big, noisy, biological sequence data. Our higher-level goal is to elucidate data-driven insights into the underlying biological mechanisms for sequence-function relationships. This remains an important endeavor, because unders1tanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype can help to prioritize disease-associated genomic variants, which can (eventually) lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for complex diseases, including cancer.
