<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">How does the brain represent, process, and regulate pain and affective experiences? The mission of our lab is basically to answer these questions to better understand pain and emotional distress, promoting the physical and psychological well-being of our family members, our friends, and our neighbors who suffer from pain and emotional distress.</span> 

<span style="font-size: 16px !important; color: #BD0026;"><b>Translational Neuroimaging 2.0: Developing integrated brain models of mental processes or clinical outcomes</b></span> 

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Our research focuses on developing good neuroimaging models and markers that are predictive of mental processes and health-related outcomes. For the last two decades, neuroimaging has transformed how we study human behaviors and mental processes, but has yet to substantially impact clinical practice and public health. One important reason is that the field has focused on developing brain “maps”, not models and markers. Brain “maps” aim to identify brain regions that are associated with particular mental processes (aka 'local brain-mapping’). The goal of this approach is not to provide a complete model of symptoms or behaviors, but to test hypotheses about structure-function associations: Its focus is on whether there are any effects in one or more brain voxels or regions, rather than on whether the effects are large enough to have clinical utility. We can overcome this problem by developing integrated brain models across multiple brain regions to predict mental processes and clinical outcomes with large effect sizes. To this end, varieties of <span style="color: #BD0026;">computational models</span> can be used (<a href="#Figure 1"><b>Figure 1</b></a>). This approach might be referred to as “Translational Neuroimaging 2.0”, as it is qualitatively distinct from conventional brain mapping and has several important benefits , and this new approach can also be synergistic with recent trends of <span style="color: #BD0026;">big data</span> (the aggregation and sharing of large-scale neuroimaging datasets).</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important;">Many challenges still remain to be resolved to develop useful neuroimaging biomarkers. Challenges include developing models that generalize across studies and heterogeneous populations; developing interpretable brain models; and issues related to data aggregation and quality control of multi-site studies. Computational models and big data approaches will not, in themselves, be enough to address all these challenges. Rather, brain models should be developed and validated within a systematic biomarker development framework (<a href="#Figure 2"><b>Figure 2</b></a>), treating brain models as sharable ‘research products’ (or boundary objects) that can be tested and annotated across research groups to demonstrate generalizability across samples, research contexts, and populations. This new way of thinking about neuroimaging results integrates ideas from machine learning, ‘big data,’ reproducible research, and open science to bring translational goals within reach.
