## Postdoctoral positions

We have two postdoc positions available. See descriptions below. Interested candidates should send a cover letter with a brief statement of research interests, CV, and contact information for three references to:Â koo@cshl.edu. 


#### Machine learning postdoc 

<b>Job description:</b> The successful postdoctoral candidate will develop deep learning systems to address cutting edge problems in regulatory genomics. Candidates with prior knowledge of computational biology or a machine learning background with strong interest in transitioning into biological data space are encouraged to apply.  


<b>Qualifications:</b> PhD in Computer Science, Physics, (Applied) Math, Statistics, Engineering or other quantitative field. Graduate students expecting to complete their doctoral studies within the next 12 months are also welcome to apply. Machine learning experience is required, as is enthusiasm for biology or biomedicine. In-depth knowledge of one or more of the following: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, transformer networks, normalizing flows, adversarial attacks/training, and interpretability techniques for black-box models. Ideal candidates will have strong communication skills and a desire to work in an interdisciplinary environment. Prior experience with biological sequence data is a plus, but not necessary.

Position Number: 02452-R


#### Computational biology postdoc


<b>Job description:</b> The successful postdoctoral candidate will tackle challenging problems at the interface of deep learning and regulatory genomics. The candidate is expected to come up with their own research directions as long as it falls within the scope of the lab. Such topics include the identification of regulatory elements and their higher-order interactions -- i.e. regulatory codes -- for gene expression, alternative splicing, or RNA-protein interactions. Candidates with a strong biology background are encouraged to apply. Prior experience with machine learning is a plus, but not necessary. 

<b>Qualifications:</b> PhD in Biology, Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Computer Science or other quantitative field. Graduate students expecting to complete their doctoral studies within the next 12 months are also welcome to apply. Ideal candidates will have strong communication skills and a desire to work in an interdisciplinary environment. Experience with python programming is required.



## Graduate student openings

We have openings for graduate students interested in rotating, joining, or just conversing about science. Email koo@cshl.edu to set up a time to discuss potential opportunities.
