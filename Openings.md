## Postdoctoral positions

We have two postdoc positions available (see descriptions below). Interested candidates should send a cover letter with a brief statement of research interests, CV, and contact information for three references to koo@cshl.edu. 


### Machine learning postdoc 

<b>Job description:</b> The successful candidate will develop deep learning solutions to address cutting edge problems in regulatory genomics. Candidates with prior knowledge of computational biology or a machine learning background with a strong interest in transitioning into biological data space are encouraged to apply.  


<b>Qualifications:</b> A PhD in Computer Science, Physics, (Applied) Math, Statistics, Engineering or other quantitative field is required. Machine learning experience is required, as is enthusiasm for biology or biomedicine. In-depth knowledge of one or more of the following is required: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, transformer networks, normalizing flows, adversarial attacks/training, and interpretability techniques for black-box models. Ideal candidates will have strong communication skills and a desire to work in an interdisciplinary environment. Prior experience with biological sequence data is a plus, but not necessary.


### Computational biology postdoc


<b>Job description:</b> The successful candidate will apply deep learning methods to address challenging regulatory genomics problems that fall within the lab’s broad interests in gene expression, alternative splicing, or RNA-protein interactions. Candidates with a strong biology background and experience solving biological problems with computational methods are encouraged to apply. Prior experience with machine learning is a plus, but not necessary. 

<b>Qualifications:</b> A PhD in Biology, Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Computer Science or other related field is required. Ideal candidates will have strong communication skills and a desire to work in an interdisciplinary environment. Experience with python programming is required.
