### 1. Postdoc in deep learning, biophysics, and genomics 

We are looking to jointly hire a postdoc to spearhead a newly formed collaboration with the Kinney Lab, the goal of which is to bridge the divide between “black-box” deep neural network models in genomics and mechanistically interpretable biophysical models of gene regulation.

<b>Qualifications:</b> Candidates must have (or soon receive) a PhD in Computational Biology, Biophysics, Bioengineering, or related discipline. Candidates must also have one or more first-author research publications and/or pre-prints in the field of quantitative biology, broadly defined. Candidates should have strong written and oral communication skills, the ability to navigate and synthesize relevant research literature, a working knowledge of Python programming, and a familiarity with mathematical methods in machine learning. Experience with the computational analysis of biological sequence data, public genomic databases, deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX), and statistical mechanics at the undergraduate level is a plus.

<b>Apply:</b> Interested candidates should email Dr. Kinney (jkinney@cshl.edu) and Dr. Koo (koo@cshl.edu) to briefly explain why they are interested in this position. Promising candidates will then be encouraged to formally apply via the CSHL careers website and to provide a cover letter, CV, and contact information for two individuals who can supply letters of reference. Please do not hesitate to reach out to Dr. Kinney or Dr. Koo if you have any questions. Potential applicants should inquire about this position by 15 January 2022.

### 2. Postdoc in deep learning for cancer genomics

Potential projects include but are not limited to (1) developing deep learning solutions to address cutting edge problems in cancer genomics, working closely with wet lab experimentalist at the CSHL Cancer Center and (2) developing and interpreting transformer-based language models for protein and RNA sequences. 

<b>Qualifications:</b> A PhD in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, Computer Science or related field is required. Strong computational biology and machine learning experience is required. Ideal candidates will be self-driven, have strong written and oral communication skills, and a desire to work in an interdisciplinary environment. Experience with deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX) is a plus.

<b>Apply:</b> Interested applicants should submit a cover letter with a brief statement of research interests, CV, and contact information for 2-3 references to koo@cshl.edu.
