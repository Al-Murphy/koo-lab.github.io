## Postdoctoral research positions

We're hiring postdocs! Potential projects include but are not limited to 1) developing deep learning solutions to address cutting edge problems in cancer genomics, working closely with wet lab experimentalist at the CSHL Cancer Center; 2) advancing design principles for deep neural networks to improve their interpretability and robustness properties for regulatory genomics; 3) developing and interpreting language models for protein and RNA sequences. Candidates with prior knowledge of computational biology or a machine learning background with a strong interest in transitioning into (cancer) genomics are encouraged to apply.

<b>Qualifications:</b> A PhD in Computer Science, Physics, (Applied) Math, Statistics, Bioinformatics, Engineering or other quantitative field is required. Machine learning experience is required, as is enthusiasm for biology or biomedicine. Ideal candidates will be driven, have strong communication skills and a desire to work in an interdisciplinary environment. Prior experience with biological data is a plus, but not necessary.

Interested applicants should submit a cover letter with a brief statement of research interests, CV, and contact information for three references to koo@cshl.edu.
