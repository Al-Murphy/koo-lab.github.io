### Research Interests

I am interested in the intersection between biology, mathematics, and computer science. I previously worked in a neurodegeneration lab, where my research centered on finding novel proteins involved in ALS. In the future, I hope to apply deep learning techniques on genomics and computational neuroscience related projects.
