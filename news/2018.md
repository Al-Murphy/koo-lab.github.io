<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Congratulations, Jaejoong! The GPF is  highly competitive (this year, the competition rate was 5.3:1), but we knew Jaejoong would get it. :) Also great great job, Cocoanlab! All lab members helped him and worked together to make this happen. Wani said that he is so proud of Cocoanlab!</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">For one-month period (6/25-7/20), Hongji (a grad student) and summer interns worked together on a very exciting new project on decoding stories based on brain activity. They almost completed experiment codes. Unfortunately, we didn't make it to fMRI data analysis. Yejin and Wonkyung, please come back to the lab if you'd like to continue the fMRI experiments and analyses you've started here. :)</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">A paper titled "Cognitive self-regulation influences pain-related physiology" was posted on bioRxiv</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">You can see the paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/04/361519">here</a>, and I wrote some background story about the paper on <a href="https://twitter.com/choongwanwoo/status/1015173555984654337">twitter</a>.</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">A paper on "Generalizable representations of pain, cognitive control, and negative emotion in medial frontal cortex" is in press on <i>Nature Neuroscience</i></span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Phil Kragel (a postdoc in Tor Wager's lab) is the first author of the [paper](/publication/#NN_Kragel2018). Wani contributed to this study by sharing our recent fMRI data. Wani <i>knew</i> that this paper will become big from the beginning! :) Wani was so happy and appreciate to be a part of this study. Thanks, Phil. You did a great job! </span>
