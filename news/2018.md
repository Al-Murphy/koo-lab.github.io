<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Wani's letter to the lab:

Hope everyone went home well yesterday night. As I said to some people yesterday, 2018 was a critical period for our lab. 

I think we were greatly successful. First and foremost, I like you all a lot. I feel ‚Äúconnected‚Äù. I‚Äôm enjoying working with you. My colleague profs call me ‚Äúthe king of meeting.‚Äù I think I can‚Äôt have that many meetings if I don‚Äôt enjoy it. 

Second, we are doing good science of neuroimaging‚Äîwe successfully finished a few projects (Caps, Semic, Fast) and some are ongoing (pico, pleasure). We submitted a revision of our first lab paper (replication), and working on a few more manuscripts (xain, caps, sequential). The most important thing is that many of you are taking a lead on your own projects now. As Byeol said yesterday, it‚Äôs important to have your own thoughts and ideas about how to solve the given problems. Ultimately, you should find the research questions that excite you the most (and also excite the PI as well üôÇ) on your own. I think some of you are already getting there. In the near future, you will be able to do the research you want with a minimal help from me. 

Third, we are successfully recruiting people‚Äîwe got sungwoo (thanks for coming to the cocoan lab) and other new undergrads who are excited to work in the lab. Lada entered our PhD program (thanks you!). I‚Äôm sorry that we lost some good people as well, but we are strong enough to be okay even after they left. 

Let‚Äôs make 2019 a great year again. I will do my best to support your growth, to be available to you, and to come up with good research/analysis ideas (and grants). And let‚Äôs publish good papers, which will give you a great joy and happiness. üôÇ

Thanks all!!!

Wani

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;"><span style="color: #1c9099;">Jaejoong Lee</span> and <span style="color: #1c9099;">Byeol Kim</span> successfully presented their beautiful work at the Society for Neuroscience 2018</span></b>

<img src="/news/images/SFN2018.jpg" width="700" align="center" hspace="20" />

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Jaejoong gave a talk titled "An fMRI Signature of Tonic Pain: Based on whole-brain functional connectivity" at a Pain Neuroimaging Nanosymposium, and Byeol presented a poster titled "Dynamic modeling and brain decoding of internal thoughts and emotions." We look forward to posting our work on a preprint server soon. Stay tuned!</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;"><span style="color: #1c9099;">Jaejoong Lee</span> is selected to receive the Global PhD Fellowship (GPF, Í∏ÄÎ°úÎ≤åÎ∞ïÏÇ¨Ìé†Î°úÏö∞Ïã≠) from Korean National Research Foundation.</span></b>

<img src="/news/images/JJ_bookshelf.jpg" width="700" align="center" hspace="20" />

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Congratulations, Jaejoong! The GPF is  highly competitive (this year, the competition rate was 5.3:1), but we knew Jaejoong would get it. :) Also great great job, Cocoanlab! All lab members helped him and worked together to make this happen. Wani said that he is so proud of Cocoanlab!</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;"><span style="color: #1c9099;">Yejin Chung</span> and <span style="color: #1c9099;">Wonkyung Choi</span> successfully finished 2018 CNIR summer internship program.</span></b>

<img src="/news/images/Summerinterns2018.jpg" width="800" align="center" hspace="20" />

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">For one-month period (6/25-7/20), Hongji (a grad student) and summer interns worked together on a very exciting new project on decoding stories based on brain activity. They almost completed experiment codes. Unfortunately, we didn't make it to fMRI data analysis. Yejin and Wonkyung, please come back to the lab if you'd like to continue the fMRI experiments and analyses you've started here. :)</span>

<br>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">A paper titled "Cognitive self-regulation influences pain-related physiology" was posted on bioRxiv</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">You can see the paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/04/361519">here</a>, and I wrote some background story about the paper on <a href="https://twitter.com/choongwanwoo/status/1015173555984654337">twitter</a>.</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">A paper titled "False-positive neuroimaging: Undisclosed flexibility in testing anatomical region-based hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding" (first author: Yongwook) has been submitted and now is under review</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Phil Kragel (a postdoc in Tor Wager's lab) is the first author of the [paper](/publication/#NN_Kragel2018). Wani contributed to this study by sharing our recent fMRI data. Wani <i>knew</i> that this paper will become big from the beginning! :) Wani was so happy and appreciate to be a part of this study. Thanks, Phil. You did a great job! </span>
