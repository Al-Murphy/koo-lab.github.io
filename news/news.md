<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #BD0026;">Dec 2017 </span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">A paper on "Generalizable representations of pain, cognitive control, and negative emotion in medial frontal cortex" is in press on <i>Nature Neuroscience</i></span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Phil Kragel (a postdoc in Tor Wager's lab) is the first author of the paper. I contributed to this study by sharing our recent fMRI data. I <i>knew</i> that this paper will become big from the beginning! :) I was so happy and appreciate to be a part of this study. Thanks, Phil. You did a great job! I cannot share its PDF until it becomes fully available on Nature Neuroscience. Stay tuned.

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #BD0026;">February 2017 </span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Our paper on developing predictive models for pain using multi-study fMRI data is published on <i>Nature Communications</i>.</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;"> It's finally <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14211">online</a> (<a href="/pdfs/Woo_2017_NCOMMS.pdf">pdf</a>; see [Publication](/publication/) for more links). In this new paper, we identified a new fMRI pattern that is predictive of pain above and beyond stimulus intensity and nociceptive brain response. Tor and I had this analysis idea since my second year of the graduate school, and I did the first version of this study as a final project for Tor's fMRI method class. Thanks to our lab's collaborative efforts to create the large-scale single-trial pain dataset, I was able to scale up the study, and the final version of the study ended up including data from six different pain studies (_N_ = 183). This was one of the main reasons that our paper was able to be published on _Nature Communications_. The pattern we identified explained variation in trial-by-trial pain ratings not captured by a previous fMRI-based marker for nociceptive pain (i.e., <a href="../pdfs/Wager_2013_NEJM.pdf">Neurologic Pain Signature</a>). In addition, the new pattern mediated the pain-modulating effects of three psychological manipulations of expectations and perceived control. We hope that the new pattern signature provides a generalizable and extensible characterization of cerebral contributions to pain and specific brain targets for interventions.</span>
