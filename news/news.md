<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;"><span style="color: #1c9099;">Jaejoong Lee</span> is selected to receive the Global PhD Fellowship (GPF, 글로벌박사펠로우십) from Korean National Research Foundation.</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Congratulations, Jaejoong! The GPF is  highly competitive (this year, the competition rate was 5.3:1), but we knew Jaejoong would get it. :) Also great great job, Cocoanlab! All lab members helped him and worked together to make this happen. Wani said that he is so proud of Cocoanlab!</span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;"><span style="color: #1c9099;">Yejin Chung</span> and <span style="color: #1c9099;">Wonkyung Choi</span> successfully finished 2018 CNIR summer internship program.</span></b>

<img src="images/Summerinterns2018.jpg" width="800" align="center" hspace="20" />

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">For one-month period (6/25-7/20), Hongji (a grad student) and summer interns worked together on a very exciting new project on decoding stories based on brain activity. They almost completed experiment codes. Unfortunately, we didn't make it to fMRI data analysis. Yejin and Wonkyung, please come back to the lab if you'd like to continue the fMRI experiments and analyses you've started here. :)</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #BD0026;">February 2017 </span>

<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Our paper on developing predictive models for pain using multi-study fMRI data is published on <i>Nature Communications</i>.</span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;"> It's finally <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14211">online</a> (<a href="/pdfs/Woo_2017_NCOMMS.pdf">pdf</a>; see [Publication](/publication/) for more links). In this new paper, we identified a new fMRI pattern that is predictive of pain above and beyond stimulus intensity and nociceptive brain response. Tor and I had this analysis idea since my second year of the graduate school, and I did the first version of this study as a final project for Tor's fMRI method class. Thanks to our lab's collaborative efforts to create the large-scale single-trial pain dataset, I was able to scale up the study, and the final version of the study ended up including data from six different pain studies (_N_ = 183). This was one of the main reasons that our paper was able to be published on _Nature Communications_. The pattern we identified explained variation in trial-by-trial pain ratings not captured by a previous fMRI-based marker for nociceptive pain (i.e., <a href="../pdfs/Wager_2013_NEJM.pdf">Neurologic Pain Signature</a>). In addition, the new pattern mediated the pain-modulating effects of three psychological manipulations of expectations and perceived control. We hope that the new pattern signature provides a generalizable and extensible characterization of cerebral contributions to pain and specific brain targets for interventions.</span>
